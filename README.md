### How to contribute

- Find a repository that you are interested in, using the `Type to search` box at the top of the page.
- Read the README.md file and any other documentation within the repository.
- If you find any issues (bugs) whilst using the project, politely reach out to the maintainers and inform them.
- 'Issues' are a way to notify the maintainers of the repository, of any bugs found.
- If you know how to fix the issue (bug) ask, to be assigned to help.
- Fix the bug, create a pull request and wait for your pull request to merged by the maintainer of the project.
- Be patient, as most maintainers also have other commitments.
- Most importantly, enjoy supporting the Open Source community.
